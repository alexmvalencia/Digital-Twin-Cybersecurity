## Purpose of the High-Level Diagram
The high-level diagram provides a detailed breakdown including:
- **Real World Drone:** Holybro X500 V2 PX4 and the data collection
- **Digital Representation:** Digital representation of the virtual digital twin in Gazebo
- **Communication Layer:** The transfer of data/saved data using Python Libraries to analyze data and the LLM to improve the security
- **Information Sharing:** How the information is shared to evaluate the data (accuracy, predictive accuracy) and various parameters looked at like jamming/spoofing
